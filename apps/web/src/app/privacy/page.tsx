    title: "When data is shared",
    body: <p>Recruitment content is shared with other users only as the service requires—for example, an employer can see information a seeker submits with an application, and seekers can see published employer and job information. We use Supabase for authentication, database, and file storage; Stripe for payment processing; Expo for push delivery; and Sentry for crash diagnostics. We do not sell personal data or share it for third-party advertising.</p>

  {
    title: "Legal bases and international transfers",
    body: <p>Depending on where you live, we process data to perform our contract with you, pursue legitimate interests such as security and service improvement, comply with legal obligations, and act on consent where required. Service providers may process data outside your country. Where applicable, we use contractual and other safeguards required for international transfers.</p>
  },
  {
    title: "Retention and security",
    body: <p>We retain information while your account is active and as needed for the purposes above. After deletion, limited records may be retained where legally required or necessary to resolve disputes and prevent fraud. We use access controls, encryption in transit, row-level database policies, and other reasonable safeguards, but no system can guarantee absolute security.</p>
  },
  {
    title: "Your choices and rights",
    body: <p>You can update profile information and notification preferences in the app. You can delete your account from Profile → Account → Delete account. Depending on your location, you may also request access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability, or object to processing, and may complain to your local data-protection authority.</p>
  },
  {
    title: "Children",
    body: <p>TalentSouq is not intended for children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 16.</p>
  },
  {
    title: "Changes and contact",
    body: <p>We may update this policy and will post the revised date here. Questions or privacy requests can be sent to <a href={`mailto:${BRAND.email.privacy}`}>{BRAND.email.privacy}</a>. The responsible entity is Triovate Management Consultancies L.L.C, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</p>
